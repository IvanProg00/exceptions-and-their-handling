# Task 2

Implement a method that takes an integer array and some value as an argument. The
method searches for the specified value in the array and returns its index. At the
same time, for example:

- If the length of the array is less than some specified minimum, the method returns
  -1 as an error code.
- If the desired element is not found, the method returns -2 as an error code.
- If null came instead of an array, the method will return -3.

Come up with your own versions of exceptional situations and return the appropriate
error codes.

Write a method in which to implement user interaction. That is, this method will
request the desired number from the user, call the first one, process the returned
value and show the readable result to the user. For example, if -2 is returned,
the user will see a message: "The desired element is not found."
