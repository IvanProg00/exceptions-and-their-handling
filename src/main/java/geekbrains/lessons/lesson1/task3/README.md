# Task 3

Implement a method that takes an integer two-dimensional array as an argument. It
is necessary to calculate and return the sum of the elements of this array.

At the same time, we impose restrictions on the method 2:

- The method can only work with square arrays (number of rows = number of columns).
- Each cell can contain only the value 0 or 1.

If one of the conditions is violated, the method should throw a RuntimeException
with an error message.
