# Task 3

Implement a method that reads data from a file and saves it to a two-dimensional
array (or HashMap, if students are familiar with it). In a separate method, you will
need to go through the data structure, if the value `?` is saved, replace it with
the corresponding number. If a character other than a number or `?` occurs in some
place, throw a suitable exception. Write data to the same file with replaced characters
`?`.
